The ship was quiet - too quiet for just the two brothers. Or it should have been. The closest teleport was on the planet just below, but two pirates still managed to teleport onto the bridge. Aun drew his phaser and took aim at the pirate. Phaser [2d6 = (1+3) = 4]

The pirate expected resistance to taking the ship, so raised his arms to block himself. Do Anything - Block [1d6 = (6) = 6] (Gained - Block [2])

The pirate ducked behind a console as he fired his own phaser blindly over the edge, as the second pirate ran over to punch Ed. A Good Fist - Running punch [2] [2d6 = (1+3) = 4]

Ed had a guess, he couldn't bend space much, but he could distort space just an inch or two, enough to make the pirate stumble. Space Manipulation - Expanding Space [1] [1d6 = (6) = 6] (Gained Expanding Space [2])

Ed figured this would be useful to remember, as the pirate's fist landed in the space just in front of him, and stumbled uselessly past with the momentum of the fist.

Noticing his friend stumble past, the first pirate yells "The battle's over there!" and glares at Ed with all that he could muster. Do Anything - Intimidate [1d6 = (3) = 3]

Test roll 2 [3d3 = (1+1+1) = 3]
