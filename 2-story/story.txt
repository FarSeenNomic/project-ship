The ship was quiet - too quiet for just the two brothers. Or it should have been. The closest teleport was on the planet just below, but two pirates still managed to teleport onto the bridge. Aun drew his phaser and took aim at the pirate. Phaser [2d6 = (1+3) = 4]
The pirate expected resistance to taking the ship, so raised his arms to block himself. Do Anything - Block [1d6 = (6) = 6] (Gained - Block [2])
The pirate ducked behind a console as he fired his own phaser blindly over the edge, as the second pirate ran over to punch Ed. A Good Fist - Running punch [2] {2d6}
