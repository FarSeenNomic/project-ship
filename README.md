# Project Ship
A ttrpg-inspired game-story that I've been working on.

## Online
If you are using the online github editor, then adding to the story is as simple as editing the file and waiting a moment for the update.

## Offline
If you are using an offline copy, then you can clone, update, and push the story as you would any other repository.
To assist, there are 3 files that pull, commit, and push updates.
