# Project Ship
A ttrpg-inspired game-story that I've been working on.

## Online
If you are using the online github editor, then adding to the story is as simple as editing the file and waiting a moment for the update.

## Offline
If you are using an offline copy, then you can clone, update, and push the story as you would any other repository.
To assist, there are 3 files that pull, commit, and push updates.

For the offline version, the files are numbered in the order to use them.

> 1-LoadUpdatesFromServer.bat

Downloads and update changed bits of story from the server's copy.

> 2-story

This is where you make any updates to the story.

> 3-SaveUpdates.bat

Saves changed to the story in the project.

> 4-PushUpdatesToServer.bat

Uploads changes from the local copy of the project.
